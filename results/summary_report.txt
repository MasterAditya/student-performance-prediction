  Cluster 2: 162 students (32.4%), Avg Grade: 78.45

KEY INSIGHTS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The Linear Regression model shows good predictive performance.
2. Key factors affecting student performance have been identified.
3. Students have been grouped into distinct clusters based on performance patterns.
4. These insights can help identify students needing additional support.

ACTIONABLE RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Focus on improving attendance and study hours for underperforming students.
2. Provide targeted support to students in lower-performing clusters.
3. Monitor key factors identified as most important for academic success.
4. Use clustering to develop personalized intervention strategies.
